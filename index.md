### About Stephanie

Mechanical Engineer by degree but **Java Developer** _By Passion_

As mechanical engineer degree major, I was more focusing on electro-mechanical, robotics, and automation minor.

I discovered my interest in coding and software developement espacially when learning **C#** during university years. I liked the OOP structure and organization so I started my own path by learning **JAVA** through MOOC and udacity nanodegrees while keeping hands-on projects.

`During Udacity courses I followed, I was able to develop and complete the following projects:`

>- [Cloud Storage](https://github.com/StephanieHallak/cloud-Storage-Spring-Boot.git) application using **SpringBoot basics** _(as big title)_ with more features and details to see in the project.
>
>- [Ecommerce](https://github.com/StephanieHallak/Security-and-DevOps-Shopping-Cart.git) application using SpringBoot, and espacially implementing **Security and DevOps** features.
>
>- [Hotel Reservation](https://github.com/StephanieHallak/Hotel-Reservation-Collections.git) application; a simple pure **Java** programme running on CLI that implements the core notion of _OOP, classes design and Collections_.
