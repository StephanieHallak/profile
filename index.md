### About Stephanie

Mechanical Engineer by degree but **Java Developer** _By Passion_

As mechanical engineer degree major, I was more focusing on electro-mechanical, robotics, and automation minor.

I discovered my interest in coding and software developement espacially when learning **C#** during university years. I liked the OOP structure and organization so I started my own path by learning **JAVA** through MOOC and udacity nanodegrees while keeping hands-on projects.
``
During Udacity courses I followed, I was able to develop and complete the following projects:

[cloud Storage](https://github.com/StephanieHallak/cloud-Storage-Spring-Boot.git) application using SpringBoot basics _as bif title_ with more features and details to see in the project.
